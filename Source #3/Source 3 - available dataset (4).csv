"The next 2 graphs were about sea level and sea level rise. So, what is the purpose of these graphs? What are we looking at? So, we are comparing temperature and global average sea level and we see they are both trending upward. So, that looks like a correlation. Ok. What else? What are these shaded areas around these lines? Did you read the fine print? Uncertainty, yeah. This is a confidence range we feel around that number. What do you notice as we get closer to present? The shaded area gets small, and that's because we have better methods. How is this related to climate change? Warmer temperatures are correlated to rising sea level. Warmer temperatures more water. We don't get that from this graph, but you are inferring that from other stuff we have looked at. So, from 3,000 years ago to present, sea level was mostly constant, rising .1 to .2 millimeters per year. That's really small so now we are looking at 1–2 mm per year. That is 10X different. And since 1992, we have risen 3 mm per year.","Impact on Earth physical systems"
