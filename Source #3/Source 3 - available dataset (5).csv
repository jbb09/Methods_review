"Lesson # and name","Student learning objectives"
"1. Introduction to climate change","Students will be able to identify the relevance of studying climate change and differentiate between elements of weather and climate"
"2. Energy budget","Students will be able to apply the concepts of energy and light to create an input/output model of energy budget for the Earth"
"3. Greenhouse gases","Students will be able to identify greenhouse gases and their sources and apply the properties of these gases and radiative forcing to model Earth's energy budget"
"4. Impacts of climate change on physical systems","Students will analyze the sources for climate data and will analyze these data to identify the impact of climate change on physical systems"
"5. Consequences on biological systems and adaptation","Students will analyze data to determine the consequences of climate change on environmental, biological, human, and social systems and identify adaptation strategies for these consequences"
"6. Climate change mitigation","Students will be able to compare and contrast climate change mitigation strategies (macro and micro) in light of environmental, economic, political, and ethical impact"
