"Frame codes","Definitions","Transcript text examples"
"Agreement frames",,
" Consensus","Emphasizing scientific or societal agreement","We know that humans are responsible for significant increased carbon emissions that have an impact on physical and biological systems of earth. We know that. We have learned that"
" Controversy","Emphasizing scientific or societal disagreements","The debate was not about whether climate change was happening, but about whether it was humans causing it. That was the debate"
"Attribution frames",,
" Humans","Human-caused climate change","What we agree upon is that humans are responsible for significant increased carbon emissions that have an impact on physical and biological systems"
" Natural","Naturally occurring climate change","It is good to recognize that we have that normal cycling, increasing and decreasing the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere"
"Impact frames",,
" People","Stressing effect on humans","A lot of people get their water from glacial melt in Asia from the Himalaya. A lot of loss, a lot of thinning. Billions of people get their drinking water from glacier melting in spring"
" Wildlife","Using animals or plants as icons","They are moving up, but how high are the Sierras? Not that much higher than that. So where do the Pikas go? You can see them in Yosemite. We are looking at a possible extinction of a very cute animal"
" Earth's physical systems","Using examples of impact on the physical systems of Earth","The last set here … we have severe weather. What does this graph actually tell us? Increase in days with very heavy precipitation"
"Problem sphere frames",,
" Scientific issue","Consideration of climate change as an issue of science","This is a picture of how surface temperatures have changed since … This is the 2000 to 2005 mean surface temperature difference from the records of 1951 to 1980. We use 1951 to 1980. That is a 30-year span for climate. We average that"
" Social issue","Consideration of the economic, political, and societal aspects of climate change","It made you wonder why you don't do some of these things. I wonder, too. I think it has to do with the dollar signs. Because doing nothing is pretty cheap. People, like the President, he is trying to fund some types of energy—solar energy"
"Solution frames",,
" Adaptation","Decreasing the effects/consequences of climate change","How do we adapt our lifestyle in order to deal with that warming? The wine growing people in Napa valley and Sonoma valley might decide that they need to plant different varietals of grapes in order to keep their wine businesses going in California"
" Mitigation","Decreasing the causes of climate change","There is so much resistance to stopping burning fossil fuels, but we need to bring emissions significantly lower than they are now to stabilize concentrations of CO2."
"Spatial frames",,
" Global","Using global examples or perspectives","How many [glaciers] are thinning? A lot. This is New Zealand. The snows of Kilimanjaro disappearing rapidly. What do you notice about the number of spots in the Northern and Southern hemispheres?"
" Local","Using local (Bay Area or California) examples or perspectives","What about the Bay Area? Remember we talked about this. They are saying this is the future coastline. This is South Bay. Am I going to have water front property here?"
" National/regional","Using US examples or perspectives","The Muir Glacier in Alaska in 1941. It was completely frozen, and in 2004, it was completely melted"
"Temporal frames",,
" Current issue","Emphasizing short-term time scale; mostly a result of present verb tense","We are going to look at why that is happening because, yes, it is happening"
" Future issue","Emphasizing long-term time scale; mostly a result of future verb tense","What they are saying is that maybe this is our future line if we have a 1-meter sea level rise"
"Valence frames",,
" Fear/negative","Appealing to negative emotions","We looked at that in terms of the Central Valley. Which is where what happens? Farming. If that floods, then boohoo for us"
" Hope/positive","Appealing to positive emotions","In the middle of this, some of you were scared. I got all kinds of reactions to this. So at the end, we are going to talk about what we can do"
